## Hi there! 👋

I'm Denny, a recent-graduate software engineer based in Texas.

I love designing and developing games. Ask me about game design! ✨

My main tech stack involves Python, React, and Javascript. 🐍
My favorite tools to use are the Godot Engine, Unity Engine, Procreate on the Ipad, and Blender.

I am currently learning and looking for help with full stack application development. 📚

I have built and collaborated with 10+ public repositories but privately, I've built more than 20+. 🤔

Fun Facts:
- I have a dog 🐶
- I prefer boba tea over coffee 🧋
- Hobbies: drawing, writing, and game development
